========
A Javascript-WebGL based 3D rendering library I created in my free time. Currently this package is still in Pilot Episode.
Eventually I plan to create a full blown 3D animation platform. Of the top of my head main applications being- creating animated movies, 3D scenes.

Most importantly creating 3D movies should be "easy-peasy" like drag-drop items. Anyways enough talk... let me start working and show some results.

Stay tuned...
